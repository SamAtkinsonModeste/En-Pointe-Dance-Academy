"Welcome to your final year, third years. 
This is the year where you make 
some of the most important decisions of your career.

In just a few months, the third-year showcase will be upon us.
Agents, directors, company heads—they will all be watching, 
looking for the next stars, 
the next leaders in dance.
And trust me, they won’t just be watching your technique. 
They’ll be watching your passion, 
your creativity, and your commitment to this craft.

Each of you will be making choices this year—whether it’s ballet, 
jazz, modern, or something else entirely. 
The choice is yours, but it’s a choice that demands everything.

Work harder than you ever have, and most importantly,
stay true to who you are.

Let’s make this year unforgettable."
